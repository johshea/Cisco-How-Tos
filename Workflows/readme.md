# Cisco Workflows Beginnerâ€™s Guide
_Last updated: 2025-08-21_

## 1. Introduction

Cisco **Workflows** is a cloudâ€‘based, low/noâ€‘code automation platform embedded in the Cisco Meraki Dashboard (Early Access 2025). It lets you design, run, and govern automations across Cisco products (Meraki, Catalyst, SDâ€‘WAN, ACI, ISE) and external systems (ServiceNow, Infoblox, REST APIs, SSH, Ansible).

This guide is designed for beginners: weâ€™ll break down the interface, share best practices, and walk through a few **simple examples**.

## 2. Interface Breakdown

When you open **Automation â†’ Workflows â†’ New Workflow**, youâ€™ll see the **Workflow Editor**. Hereâ€™s how itâ€™s structured:

### a. Canvas
- The central area where you **drag and drop activities** (building blocks).
- Workflows flow left â†’ right, starting with **Start** and ending with **End** nodes.

### b. Activities Panel
- Located on the left.
- Contains **Cisco activities** (e.g., Meraki â†’ List Networks), **Generic adapters** (REST, SSH, PowerShell), and **Logic blocks** (If, For Each, Script, Approval, etc.).

### c. Variables Panel
- Define **Inputs** (provided when workflow runs), **Locals** (used internally), and **Secrets** (API keys, passwords).
- Inputs can be marked **required** and surfaced in the run wizard.

### d. Properties Panel
- When you click an activity, its **properties** appear here.
- Example: For a REST activity â†’ URL, Method, Headers, Body.

### e. Toolbar
- **Save, Run, Debug, Publish** options.
- **Undo/Redo** and zoom controls for the canvas.

### f. Run Logs & History
- After running a workflow, logs appear at the bottom.
- You can inspect **inputs, outputs, errors, and approvals** for each activity.

---

## 3. Best Practices

### a. Design
- **Start simple**: one task, then expand.
- Use **Inputs** for anything that may change (e.g., network name, VLAN ID).
- Normalize naming: `camelCase` for variables.

### b. Security
- Store credentials in **Secrets/Targets** (never in plain text).
- Use **HMAC or token authentication** for webhooks.
- Restrict workflow editing with **RBAC**.

### c. Reliability
- Always include a **dryâ€‘run mode**.
- Add **approval gates** for productionâ€‘impacting actions.
- Use **Try/Retry** on API calls that may rateâ€‘limit.

### d. Reusability
- Break down large automations into **smaller subâ€‘workflows**.
- Document variables and outputs clearly.
- Version workflows; keep copies in GitHub.

### e. Observability
- Emit **structured logs** (`JSON.stringify`) instead of plain text.
- Include correlation IDs (e.g., change ticket #) in logs and outputs.

## 4. Simple Examples

### Example 1 â€” Hello World (Log a Message)
1. Create a new workflow â†’ name it `Hello_World`.
2. Drag a **Log Activity** to the canvas.
3. Set Message: `"Hello Cisco Workflows!"`
4. Connect Start â†’ Log â†’ End.
5. Run it. Output shows the log entry.

---

### Example 2 â€” List Networks in a Meraki Org
1. Inputs: `orgId` (string).
2. Drag **Meraki â†’ List Networks**.
   - Input: `organizationId = {orgId}`
3. Drag **Log Activity** â†’ set message to:  
   ```
   Networks: {JSON.stringify(activity.listNetworks.output)}
   ```
4. Run workflow with a valid `orgId`.  
   Youâ€™ll see all networks printed.

---

### Example 3 â€” Webhook Triggered Logger
1. Inputs: `rawBody` (string).
2. Create a **Webhook Automation Rule** â†’ map body â†’ `rawBody`.
3. In workflow, add a **Script Activity**:  
   ```js
   try {
     payload = JSON.parse(rawBody);
     console.log("Received payload:", payload);
   } catch (e) {
     throw new Error("Invalid JSON");
   }
   ```
4. Add a **Log Activity**:  
   `Message: Webhook received for device ${payload.device}`

---

### Example 4 â€” Simple Switchport Config (Meraki)
1. Inputs: `serial` (string), `portId` (string), `vlanId` (integer).
2. Add a **REST â†’ PUT** activity:
   - URL:  
     ```
     https://api.meraki.com/api/v1/devices/{serial}/switch/ports/{portId}
     ```
   - Headers:  
     ```
     Authorization: Bearer {merakiApiKey}
     Content-Type: application/json
     ```
   - Body:  
     ```json
     {
       "type": "access",
       "vlan": {vlanId}
     }
     ```
3. Run workflow â†’ it updates the switchport VLAN.

## 5. Next Steps

- Explore the **Cisco Workflow Exchange** for prebuilt automations.
- Practice with **Meraki** APIs (SSIDs, VLANs, Alerts).
- Add **Approvals** and **Dryâ€‘run** to your simple workflows.
- Try connecting to thirdâ€‘party systems (e.g., ServiceNow, Slack).

---

## 6. Quick Reference

- **Activities** = building blocks (Meraki, REST, SSH, logic).  
- **Variables** = inputs, locals, secrets.  
- **Rules** = triggers (Webhook, Schedule, Manual).  
- **Best Practices** = security, dryâ€‘run, approvals, logs.
